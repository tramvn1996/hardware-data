# 2 facts to replicate from the Backblaze Hard Drive Stats for 2017 report:
- 81.76 — The number of hard drives that were installed each day in 2017. 
	This includes new drives, migrations, and failure replacements.
- 4.13 — The average number of hard drives that have failed each day in 2017.

# Results:
- The number of hard drives that were installed each day in 2017: 53.055
- The average number of hard drives that have failed each day in 2017 : 4.41

# Conclusion:
- The average number of hard drives that failed is consistent with the 
	website statistics
- The number of hard drives, on the other hand, are a little off. I suspect
	this might happen because I didn't filter out when the difference number
	of hard drives between days are negative. 
- I ran this on all the 2017 datasets, and it took about 163 seconds (almost 3 mins)
	to run
